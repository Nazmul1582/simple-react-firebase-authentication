# Simple React Firebase Authentication

- This is a simple react firebase authentication project. 
- This project has built using react, vite, firebase, react-router etc.


## Important Notes

- if I set `null` as the initial value of user (like: `const [user, setUser] = useState(null)`), I **can show** user-information using `{user && <p>{user.email}</p>}`
- If I set empty object: `{}` as the initial value of user (like: `const [user, setUser] = useState({})`), I **can not show** user-information using `{user && <p>{user.email}</p>}` because: here, `user means {}` which value is `true`. So, I have to use `user.email && ........`

- using `{}` is better then `null` when I want to access `user.uid` means `{}.uid ==> undefined`, It don't show error. But using `null` shows error when I want to access `user.uid` means `null.uid ==> error`
